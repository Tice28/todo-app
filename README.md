<h1>Todo App</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project was to create a todo app that has more complex features than your typical CRUD todo app.</p>

<p>The project is not "bug free", but it is functional and can be used without issue within normal use cases.</p>

<h2>Skills I Practiced</h2>
<ul>
<li>Applications of grid and flex</li>
<li>Mobile first development</li>
<li>Creating simple SVGs to work as category icons</li>
<li>The use of pseudo classes for interactivity</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mistakes I Made</h2>

<ul>
<li>Reinitalizing DOM objects each for each function rather than implementing them at the top of the document.</li>
<li>Nesting objects deep inside other objects making it complicated to access information.</li>
<li>Using inputs instead of selects when creating the priority/categories options.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I Would Do Differently</h2>

<ul>
<li>Structure data first, then decide how DOM would display that data.</li>
<li>Consistent CSS and JS naming and file structure</li>
</ul>

<h2>How I Would Further This Project</h2>

<ul>
<li>Create functional backend to store/retrieve task, icon, and category data rather than using local storage</li>
<li>Add more options for category icons</li>
<li>Add search and sort features for current tasks</li>
<li>Add additional style rules that depend on late, on time, and almost late tasks.</li>
</ul>
